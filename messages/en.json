    "journey": "Hi! I‚Äôm Simon. A self-taught programmer who realized code could build worlds‚Äîor at least, really fun retro games.<br></br><br></br>My first encounter with coding was in 2018, when I stumbled on a YouTube video of someone building Tetris in C++. I was 16 and obsessed: Wait, you can just‚Ä¶ make games? So I dove in, armed with C++ tutorials and dreams of recreating every pixelated classic I‚Äôd ever played (Snake, Frogger‚Äîyou name it).<br></br><br></br>Fast-forward to today: I‚Äôm a Software Engineer at a startup, wrangling Next.js, NestJS, and Stripe to build apps that actually earn money (a wild concept to 16-year-old-me). My proudest moment? Learning payment integrations and seeing strangers use‚Äîand pay for‚Äîsomething I helped create.<br></br><br></br>But I‚Äôm itching for my next challenge. I love full-stack work‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs crafting sleek UIs with shadcn or debugging backend mysteries. And while I didn‚Äôt take the traditional CS path, my time building systems and web apps proved something: code isn‚Äôt just about games; it‚Äôs about solving real problems.<br></br><br></br>When I'm not coding, I'm probably at the gym, sleeping, or dead.<br></br><br></br>I focus on clean fundamentals, building systems that are sustainable, easy to maintain, and built to last.",
