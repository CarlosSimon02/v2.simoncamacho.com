    "journey": "Hi! I’m Simon. A self-taught programmer who realized code could build worlds—or at least, really fun retro games.<br></br><br></br>My first encounter with coding was in 2018, when I stumbled on a YouTube video of someone building Tetris in C++. I was 16 and obsessed: Wait, you can just… make games? So I dove in, armed with C++ tutorials and dreams of recreating every pixelated classic I’d ever played (Snake, Frogger—you name it).<br></br><br></br>Fast-forward to today: I’m a Software Engineer at a startup, wrangling Next.js, NestJS, and Stripe to build apps that actually earn money (a wild concept to 16-year-old-me). My proudest moment? Learning payment integrations and seeing strangers use—and pay for—something I helped create.<br></br><br></br>But I’m itching for my next challenge. I love full-stack work—whether it’s crafting sleek UIs with shadcn or debugging backend mysteries. And while I didn’t take the traditional CS path, my time building systems and web apps proved something: code isn’t just about games; it’s about solving real problems.<br></br><br></br>When I'm not coding, I'm probably at the gym, sleeping, or dead.<br></br><br></br>I focus on clean fundamentals, building systems that are sustainable, easy to maintain, and built to last.",

I chose these technologies to solidify my understanding of the core tools in web development before jumping into more complex frameworks. Now, you might wonder why I picked Sass over plain old CSS. Well, dealing with one massive CSS file can be a nightmare. Sass, on the other hand, keeps everything organized and tidy. If I need to tweak a style, I can do it without tearing my hair out searching through lines of code."
