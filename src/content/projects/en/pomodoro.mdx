  <TitleContent title="Purpose and Goal">
    After wrapping up my CodeGuage course on JavaScript, I was itching to put my
    newfound skills to the test. Building a Pomodoro web app seemed like the
    perfect challenge. Not only could it help me stay productive, but its sleek
    design also made it an exciting project to dive into. My main goal was
    simple: to gain hands-on experience by building a high-quality, functional
    project that I could be proud of.

  <TitleContent title="Problems and Thought Process">
    While coding the settings part of my Pomodoro app, I noticed my JavaScript
    file was ballooning to 587 lines! I knew I had to get organized. After
    scouring the internet, I realized there's no one right way to structure
    JavaScript code. I often look for the "correct" method, but in reality,
    there are many ways to approach a problem. I found the MVC architecture and
    decided to use it even though it’s not the most common choice for
    JavaScript. Sometimes, you have to go with what works for you, even if it’s
    unconventional.
    <br />
    Another challenge was understanding technical documentation. Implementing
    push notifications was tough because the language was so technical. This
    highlighted the need for me to get comfortable with these texts and
    technical terms to be more efficient in my work.
    <br />
    Other than that, most of my questions were basic, like how to implement a
    timer, make it accessible, or add a progress bar, but I found answers
    quickly thanks to the amazing online community. Overall, it was a fantastic
    learning experience that helped me improve my coding practices and
    problem-solving skills.

  <TitleContent title="Lessons Learned">
    Oh boy! Where do I begin? This Frontend Mentor Challenge has provided me
    with some of the most valuable knowledge I have acquired so far, including
    Open Graph (OG), accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), Block
    Element Modifier (BEM), MVC (Model View Controller) architecture,
    validations, closures, progressive web applications (PWA), and, most
    importantly, Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM has opened my mind to using
    libraries that are immensely helpful for my projects.
    <br />
    Initially, like my previous Frontend Mentor projects, I intended to write
    the code quickly without much consideration for quality. However, everything
    changed when I watched a
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEr--yTShz8&t=394s) from one of my
    favorite C++ channels, [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno). In
    it, he emphasized that the time spent on a project does not guarantee its
    quality. If you only focus on coding without learning, the resulting code
    might not be of high quality. His words deeply resonated with me because I
    had been approaching these Frontend Mentor challenges merely to test my
    coding speed and project completion time.
    <br />
    This realization inspired me to step out of my comfort zone and delve deeper
    into research and learning. As a result, I dedicated more time to learning
    and improving my skills.
