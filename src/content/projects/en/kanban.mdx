  <TitleContent title="Purpose and Goal">
    After finishing a few projects, I wanted to build something that could
    actually make my life easier. That’s when I came up with the idea of a
    Kanban web app. I needed a better way to manage tasks, and building my own
    tool felt like the perfect challenge. My goal wasn’t just to practice the
    MERN stack—it was to create something I’d use every day, and maybe even help
    others stay organized too.

  <TitleContent title="Problems and Thought Process">
    Building this app wasn’t easy. One of the biggest hurdles was keeping
    everything in sync—when a task updated in one place, it had to instantly
    reflect everywhere else. At first, I tried juggling React’s built-in state,
    but it quickly got messy. That’s when I leaned on Zustand. Its
    straightforward API made it easy to centralize state, so I didn’t have to
    worry about data getting out of step. Suddenly, what felt like chaos became
    manageable.
    <br />
    Performance was another tricky problem. Early on, I noticed that some
    queries to MongoDB were slow, and re-rendering large sections of the board
    in React caused lag. My first instinct was to optimize React components, but
    I also had to rethink how I queried the database—fetching only what I
    needed, instead of pulling everything at once. Tailwind CSS also played a
    huge role here. Instead of fighting with long CSS files, I could quickly
    design a clean, responsive layout without adding extra weight.
    <br />
    Radix UI came with its own challenges. At first, I struggled to get its
    components to look the way I wanted, and I even considered scrapping it for
    something simpler. But once I understood how to style and extend it, the
    payoff was worth it—every piece of UI was accessible, consistent, and
    polished, which lined up perfectly with my goal of making the app usable for
    everyone.
    <br />
    Then came drag-and-drop. Beautiful DnD wasn’t just a plug-and-play solution;
    I had to figure out how to preserve task order, handle edge cases where
    items dropped outside of columns, and prevent “weird” UI glitches. The first
    few attempts were clunky, but after trial and error—tracking indexes more
    carefully and refining the drop logic—I finally got smooth, intuitive
    interactions that felt natural on the Kanban board.
    <br />
    Looking back, this project was more than just building a task manager. It
    was about tackling real-world challenges: syncing state across the app,
    squeezing performance out of both the frontend and backend, and pushing
    through the learning curve of new tools. Each obstacle forced me to think
    critically and adapt. In the end, I didn’t just build an app—I walked away
    with sharper problem-solving skills and a stronger foundation as a
    full-stack developer.

  <TitleContent title="Lessons Learned">
    This project felt like a milestone for me. It was the first time I built a
    full-stack app from scratch with the MERN stack, and I remember the thrill
    of connecting the pieces together—MongoDB for data, Express and Node.js for
    the backend, and React to bring it all to life on the frontend. Debugging my
    first database query that actually updated the UI in real time was such a
    “wow, this works!” moment.
    <br />I also discovered the value of accessibility through Radix UI. At
    first, I didn’t think much about it, but after reading [The A11Y
    Project](https://www.a11yproject.com), I realized how important it is to
    design for everyone. Radix gave me a great head start with components that
    weren’t just functional, but inclusive.
    <br />
    And of course, I couldn’t forget drag-and-drop. Implementing Beautiful DnD
    wasn’t plug-and-play—I had to wrestle with task ordering and edge cases. But
    once it clicked, moving tasks across the Kanban board felt buttery smooth,
    and that was incredibly satisfying to see in action.
