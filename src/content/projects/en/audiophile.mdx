  <TitleContent title="Purpose and Goal">
    I started this project with one main goal: to get better at React. I wanted
    to push myself by trying new tools and learning how experienced developers
    build their sites. On top of that, I wanted to sharpen my eye for detail by
    matching designs as closely as possible.
    <br />
    Another big reason was to have something solid for my portfolio. Building a
    real project meant I could actually show what I’d learned—not just talk
    about it. Along the way, I knew I’d run into tough problems, but that was
    the point: solving them was how I’d grow.

  <TitleContent title="Problems and Thought Process">
    Performance and SEO were some of the toughest hurdles. E-commerce sites need
    to be lightning fast and discoverable on search engines. Thankfully,
    [Next.js’s server-side
    rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/rendering-and-ranking) made both
    achievable. Pages loaded quickly, and I didn’t have to stress too much about
    search engines missing my content.
    <br />
    Design was a whole different story. At first, Tailwind CSS felt
    overwhelming—so many utility classes everywhere. But after watching [this
    Tailwind Crash Course on
    YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ), things started to
    click. Suddenly, building a clean, responsive UI felt natural, almost fun.
    <br />
    Looking back, this project wasn’t just about getting a shopping site
    online—it was about learning how to juggle performance, SEO, and design all
    at once. Those lessons are now baked into how I approach every new project.

  <TitleContent title="Lessons Learned">
    One of the biggest takeaways was performance. E-commerce sites can’t afford
    to be slow, so using [Next.js server-side
    rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/rendering-and-ranking) taught me how
    to build pages that load quickly and stay SEO-friendly. Seeing product pages
    render almost instantly was a big win.
    <br />
    Tailwind CSS also changed how I approach design. At first, the utility-first
    approach felt cluttered, but after building out responsive product pages, I
    realized how much time it saved. The design came together faster, and I
    could stay focused on consistency instead of writing endless CSS rules.
    <br />
    This project reinforced how important performance, design, and state
    management are in building a smooth e-commerce experience.
